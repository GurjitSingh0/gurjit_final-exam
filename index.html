			  <p>Photography is like taking pictures with a special camera. You can capture moments and memories with it. 
			  A camera has a lens that sees things like our eyes do. When you press a button, it clicks and saves that moment.
			  You can take pictures of your family, pets, or even beautiful flowers. People can be photographers and take pictures for a job. 
			  Photography is fun because you can make a picture of anything you like.
			  It’s a way to remember happy times. Just aim, click, and you’ve got a picture to keep forever.
